    header1: 'The need for taking care of our emotional health',
    paragraph2: '“Just as we observe physical hygiene to stay well, we need to cultivate a kind of emotional hygiene too,” wrote the Dalai Lama on his Twitter-feed. There are three crucial points around His Holiness’ statement. First and foremost, the popularity of health-enhancing, physically active lifestyle is soaring worldwide. Nevertheless, there’s always room for improvement: the WHO says that globally, 23 percent of adults and 81 percent of school-going adolescents are not active enough. According to the organization, adults aged 18-64 should do at least 150 minutes of moderately intense physical activity each week, which is not unaccomplishable. Moreover, the numerically and statistically driven 21st-century mind could take a great inspiration and power from the various fitness trackers and wearables.',
    paragraph3: 'Secondly, emotional hygiene seems to be thrown into the shade nowadays. Somehow, the culture of busyness prevents us from squeezing some time for mental health into our packed schedules. Information is pouring on us from millions of communication channels; we are connecting with hundreds of ‘friends’ on social media, we are obsessed with data due to the fear of missing out and time management slices up our days into meetings and to-do-lists.',
    paragraph4: 'The pressure to perform and the stress to achieve is the air every busy-bee is breathing. However, turbulent lifestyle comes with a price. No wonder so many people have mental health issues. In the US, that means one in five adults – more than 40 million Americans! On the old continent, 27 percent of the population has to cope with mental disorders, which means 83 million struggling Europeans. In Asia, the prevalence of depression is 20 percent in Thailand, 19.9 percent in Taiwan, 19.4 percent in Korea, 17.5 in Malaysia and 16.5 percent in China.'

    paragraph2: 'Forgiveness is a personal choice and the process of forgiving oneself or others for past hurt or wrongdoings can be a critical step in the healing journey. It is important to note that forgiveness does not mean forgetting or excusing the harm that was caused, but rather it is a way to let go of anger and resentment and move forward. Forgiveness can also bring a sense of peace and closure, and can ultimately help to free you from the negative emotions that may be holding you back from fully healing.',
    paragraph3: 'it is important to remember that healing from trauma is a journey and it is okay to take things one step at a time. There may be setbacks and difficult days, but with self-care, support, and time, it is possible to move forward and find hope and healing. It is also important to be gentle with yourself and to allow yourself to feel a range of emotions as you work through the healing process. Remember, healing is a process, not a destination, and it is okay to seek help and support whenever you need it.',
